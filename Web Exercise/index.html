        <h1>Exercise 03: HTML Exercise - Personal Profile Page</h1>

        <h2>Firas Fisal's Personal Profile Page</h2>

        <img src="images/img_main.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" title="Profile Picture" width="270" height="270">
        <p><i>Location: Ueno, Tokyo</i></p>

        <h3>Who am I and What interests me in life?</h3>

        <p>Before that, this is my first task in the Interactive Design module that requires us to create a personal profile page using HTML. The goal of this exercise is tohelp us practice our HTML skills and create a webpage that showcases our personal interests.</p>

        <p>I'll start by introducing myself, my name is Firas. I was a former Pre-Medical student who made the choice to leave the field and pursue my studies in the Arts Stream instead. Fast forward a couple years, I'm now close to being a 2nd-Year design student studying Bachelor of Design in Creative Media (Hons), specialising in UI/UX. You can dive into my e-portfolio to witness my creative journey and I hope that you'd enjoy the ride as much I do.</p>

        <p>I'm a <b>HUGE</b> fan of <i><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a30675971/billie-eilish-youngest-artist-to-win-top-four-grammy-categories/" target="_blank">Bille Eilish</a></i>. She is the youngest artist in Grammy history to be nomiated in all four top categories; Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Album of the Year and Best New Artist, as well as the youngest to sweep them all.</p>

        <p>Now, I'll list down a more traditional personal interests that are worth mentioning for this exercise.</p>
